    "This notebook will guide you to get started with Python from basic installation to python basic. Throughout this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install python using Anaconda (for simplicity), regardless what your OS is.\n",
    "2. Get to know with Data Types, Operators, Data Structures, Methods, and File Operation in Python\n",
    "3. Use all mentioned above to do control flow and (optionally) create functions, module, and class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Anaconda?\n",
    "\n",
    "* To simplify things, like installation issue, and simplicity.\n",
    "* Anaconda is a package manager, an environment manager, a Python/R data science distribution, and a collection of over 1,500+ open source packages. Anaconda is free and easy to install, and it offers free community support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to download the apps through this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). When you have successfully installed Anaconda, python will be installed too along with other packages distribution from anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you're on Windows, see intrusctions for [Windows here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)\n",
    "* If you're on Mac, see intrusctions for [Mac here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)\n",
    "* If you're on Linux, see intrusctions for [Linux here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main goal today is to **get everything ready** for running and to ease our learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IDE/Editor\n",
    "\n",
    "**Editor** is simply an interface or tool that allows you to edit text. Typically they are optimized for programming languages though many programmer’s text editors are branching out and adding features for non-programming text. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**, on the other hand, is intended as a set of tools that all work together: text editor, compiler, build or make integration, debugging, etc. Example of editor is like Notepad++, MS Word, etc, and IDE is like VSCode, Atom, Sublime, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, we will use Jupyter Notebook for our interactive programming and computation, and VSCode or PyCharm for scripting later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. It's developed under project jupyter, which exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages."

    "1. Only use ordinary letters, numbers and underscores in your variable names. They can’t have spaces, and need to start with a letter or underscore.\n",
    "2. You can’t use reserved words or built-in identifiers that have important purposes in Python. A list of python reserved words is described [here](https://pentangle.net/python/handbook/node52.html).\n",
