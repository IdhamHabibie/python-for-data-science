    "# Course Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, **Intro to Python for Data Science** will teach you how to get started with Python, use python to analyze your custom data, and apply simple machine learning using supporting packages. This course cover, but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python Basics <br>\n",
    "  1.1 Python for simple calculation <br>\n",
    "  1.2 Data types in python <br>\n",
    "  1.3 Data structures in python <br>\n",
    "  1.4 Control flow\n",
    "2. Modular Python <br>\n",
    "  2.1 Functions and Methods <br>\n",
    "  2.2 Built-in function and methods <br>\n",
    "  2.3 Scripting in Python\n",
    "3. Data Analysis <br>\n",
    "  3.1 Get started with Numpy and Pandas <br>\n",
    "  3.2 Simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <br>\n",
    "  3.3 Build Data Analysis Report\n",
    "4. Data Science and Machine Learning <br>\n",

    "  \n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into those stuffs, we have something to prepare first. We have to create our **environment/workflow** such that it can boost our learning process instead of figuring why it works in mine but not in yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Workflow Setup and Configuration <br>\n",
    "  0.1 Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) and install it <br>\n",
    "  0.2 Download [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it (too) <br>\n",
    "  0.3 Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and (of course) install it <br>\n",
    "  0.3 Shell workshop (Optional) - Could be done in the first week or later\n",

    "## Motivation on Python for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Data! Data! Data!\" he cried impatiently. \"I can't make bricks without clay.\" - **Arthur Conan Doyle**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is ubiquitous and we live in this kind of world. From websites, smartphones, apps, they all have our data. They know us better than ourselves. Probably, they drive us to do something, not otherwise. Buried in these data are answers to countless questions that no one's ever thought to ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people have their own definition. Also, there's a statement stating that **data scientist is someone who knows more statistics than a computer scientist and more computer science than a statistician.** Well, some people think it's a joke. Let's define ours:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data science is a process of extracting insights from messy data. Then, data scientist is the executor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python: A Readable Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is authored by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and releasing its initial version back in February 1991. Currently, the latest version of Python is 3.7.4. Earlier version of Python, which is 2.7, won't be maintained past 2020 ([see here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Things you should keep in mind while coding in Python:\n",
    "1. Python is case-sensitive\n",
    "2. Spacing is important\n",
    "3. Watch out for error message (will help you learn too)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python is used for general programming**, meaning it's used for not only data science things, but also web development, etc. Python somewhat has a [Zen](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) description of its design principles. Code written in this *python style* is often described as **Pythonic** way of coding."

    "## The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
    "Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
    "Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "Complex is better than complicated.\n",
    "Flat is better than nested.\n",
    "Sparse is better than dense.\n",
    "Readability counts.\n",
    "Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n",
    "Although practicality beats purity.\n",
    "Errors should never pass silently.\n",
    "Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
    "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n",
    "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n",
    "Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n",
    "Now is better than never.\n",
    "Although never is often better than *right* now.\n",
    "If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
    "If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n",
    "Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\n",
